# Applied Statistics Assignment - University of Galway

This repository contains the work for the Applied Statistics course at the University of Galway. The project is organized into various files and folders to meet the course requirements. Below is an explanation of the contents and structure of the repository.

### Files and Folders Overview

1. **task.ipynb**  
   This Jupyter Notebook contains the tasks assigned for the course. Each task is implemented using Python code and follows the guidelines given in the course materials. The notebook is structured in cells that execute code to solve statistical problems, visualize data, and analyze results.

2. **project.ipynb**  
   This Jupyter Notebook contains the project portion of the assignment. It extends upon the tasks in `task.ipynb` and applies statistical methods to the dataset to address more complex problems or conduct deeper analysis. It may include hypothesis testing, regression models, or advanced data visualization techniques.

3. **.gitignore**  
   This file specifies which files and directories Git should ignore when committing changes. For this project, it is configured to exclude temporary files, compiled Python files, and other non-essential files that should not be tracked by version control.

4. **images/**  
   This folder contains images that are used within the Jupyter Notebooks (e.g., for visualizations, plots, or example outputs). These images are referenced in the code cells to help explain the analysis or results.

5. **dataset/**  
   This folder contains the dataset(s) used in the project. The dataset is essential for completing the analysis and is used across various tasks in the project. The dataset is in CSV format and should be loaded into the Jupyter notebooks for data manipulation and analysis.

6. **requirements.txt**  
   This file lists all the Python dependencies required to run the Jupyter notebooks. To install the necessary packages, use the following command:
